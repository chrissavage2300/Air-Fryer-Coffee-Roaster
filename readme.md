A DIY Coffee roaster based on on air fryer. 

The idea is to have a rotating drum with a heater and fan inside. A nextion display will be used. 

Features:
Adjustable Temp
Adjustable Drum Speed
Adjustable Fan Speed
Cooling and heating modes

Change Log:

The roaster does work, but it has a slight issue when it gets hot where the rotation motor just doesnt turn. From what I can tell, its not a failure of the motor, but a fail in the comms. I have to look into why it does this, as i think its a buffer situation. Everything else works though, so Im not sure why just that gives out.
